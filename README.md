# Distributed database

This project was done for the Distributed Systems course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Bucharest.
The application implements a proof of concept distributed database system for storing integers.
The algorithm implementation is inspired by the paper [Sacrificing serializability to attain high availability of data in an unreliable network](paper.pdf)
